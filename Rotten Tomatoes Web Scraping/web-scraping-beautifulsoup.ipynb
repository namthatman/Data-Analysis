Do you want to learn how to obtain interesting, real-time and even rare information from the internet with a simple script?\n\nWeb Scraping is a technique for obtaining information from web pages or other sources of data, such as webpages, downloadable files, and APIs, through the use of intelligent automated programs. Web Scraping allows us to gather data from potentially hundreds or thousands of pages with a few lines of code. When it comes to data science â€“ more and more data comes from external sources, thus knowing how to extract and structure that data quickly is an essential skill that will set you apart in the job
